First, you need to choose a PWM channel. There are 16 channels from 0 to 15.
2) Then, you need to set the PWM signal frequency. For an LED, a frequency of 5000 
Hz is fine to use.
3) You also need to set the signal’s duty cycle resolution: you have resolutions from 
1 to 16 bits. We’ll use 8-bit resolution, which means you can control the LED 
brightness using a value from 0 to 255.
4) Next, you need to specify to which GPIO or GPIOs the signal will appear upon. For 
that you’ll use the following function:
